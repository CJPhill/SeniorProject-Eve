=========================
Proposal Document [0 points]:
Don't see a proposal document here.  Dang it.

Proposal Presentation [2 points]:
Your presentation was good.  The slides were beautiful and the project seems
like a good idea.  You presented well, everyone had a part to play and
you all seemed to know what you were going to say.  However, I don't see
a copy of your slides in your repository where they should be.

Dang.
