CMSI 4071 Fall 2024
==========================================

DETAILED CSC AND CSU DESCRIPTIONS:
   Well done on this section ~ nothing to add here.

DETAILED CLASS DESCRIPTIONS:
   Very well done on this section, complete and detailed ~ nothing to add
   here.

DETAILED INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Also very complete descriptions here ~ nice work, nothing to add here.

DETAILED DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Another win ~ you're really nailed the intent of the documentation now!
   Nothing to add here.

DETAILED DESIGN DIAGRAMS:
   Diagrams can be the real 'meat' of documentation if they are used to show
   how the parts of the project associate.  In your case, you have done such
   a good job with the text that diagrams would merely reinforce what you've
   already laid out.  Thus, the one diagram of overall flow is OK for this
   project.

DATABASE DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION:
   Since there is no database, this section is OBE.

Very nice work on this document ~ it's obvious to me that this team cares a
great deal about the project and the softwre engineering process in general,
and I'm sure you will all be wonderful software designers when you hit the
industry!  Very nice and complete work.
