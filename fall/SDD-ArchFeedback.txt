=======================================

SDD: ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN SECTION:
   Major software components section
      Good breakdown on this section.  You have done excellent work on this
      portion and obviously have planned your application well.  Nothing to
      add here.

   Major software interactions section
      Very nice work on this section as well.  You have defined the game's
      interactions clearly.  Nothing to add here.

   Architectural design diagrams section
      The diagrams are good and I like the use of color.  The text is a bit
      small, but can be read if you enlarge the document on the screen.  It
      will be hard to read on a printed copy, though.

   Total Percentage:  10/10 = 100% which is an A-plus

COMMENTS
I can't evaluate what isn't there...

Turn in a copy of the Architectural section with your Detailed Design section
and you'll get at least partial credit on this portion.

=====
Revisited:
   You fooled me since you put everything into one document and called it the
   "requirements document".  Once I found that out, I re-evaluated, and now
   you have a good score.

   Nice work!
