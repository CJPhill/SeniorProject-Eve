Software Requirements Specification
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4071 Fall 2024
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Nice work on this section.  Nothing to add here.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   This is very complete and comprehensive with the exception of the Game
   Manager section 5.3.1.3.  One requirement is not enough for this main
   component of the game.  You list all keyboard and mouse inputs but you
   should specify what each one is and what it does in the game as 'shall'
   statements.  Trying to cover that with "in relation to how they would
   influence the GUI" is nowhere near specific enough.

   EVERYTHING else is good in this section!

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   Perfect, nothing to add.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   Perfect, nothing to add.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   Category                          Points

   Subtotal                            8/8
   Preliminary Schedule                2/2
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   9.5/10 = 95% which is an A

Fix that one section as mentioned above and commit by the end of the semester
for full credit on this document.

Great job.... keep up the good work!
