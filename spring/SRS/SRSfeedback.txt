   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   10/10 = 100% which is an A-plus

I'm not sure quite how to evaluate this, since it's not in requirements form
but since there are three documents that add up to basically what would be
in a requirements document, I'm calling it good.

If this is your *design* documentation though, then you need to do something
different for your requirements.  Perhaps we should talk together about this
this coming week.

What you have done is VERY good, though.
