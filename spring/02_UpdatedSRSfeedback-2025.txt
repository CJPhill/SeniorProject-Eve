COMMENTS:
---------

Since this is a continuing group project, you were supposed to update the
   original SRS for this submission and add in new things you are going to
   do this semester.  That means additional requirements, both functional
   and performance, as well as possibly expanded or additional sections in
   those two categories.  I don't even see an SRS document in your repository
   at this point.  I can't evaluate what isn't there.

   The points you did get are due to the fact that I'm giving away points for
   those two sections.
