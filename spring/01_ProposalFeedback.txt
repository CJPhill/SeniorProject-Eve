Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Eve
=========================
Proposal Document [1 points]:
   This is the same document as before.  You were supposed to include in a
   new version what you plan to work on this semester to add to what you
   accomplished last time.  You have all the document parts from last time,
   but nothing new.  Hmmmmm...

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
   Lovely presentation as usual.  You all seem to have practiced so you know
   your parts and what you are going to say.  The slides are really pretty,
   I'm sure that's a product of your focus on the artwork.  Well done!


Summary:
--------
Total:  4% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  Not a bad start to the semester, but remember this is an
extension of your last semester's project, so you'll need to put in language
about updates and additions this time around.
