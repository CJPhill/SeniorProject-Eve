Comments/feedback:

problem 7-7, lemonade and brownies?  mmmmmmyummmm
   the sweet and the sour, ALL in one treat!

problem 8-1, this is the 'isRelativelyPrime()' function, not a program to do
   the *testing* of the function.  The problem states, "Use either your
   favorite programming language or pseudocode to write a program that tests
   the isRelativelyPrime() method."

Nice work here!  You earned 94% of 11 points which is 10.34 extra credit points.
